## Reductions

Essentially **derivations in reverse**.

<div align='center'>
G := ({S}, {(, )}, R, S)
<br>
R = S â†’ SS | (S) | Îµ
</div>

This grammar describes all strings of balanced parentheses.

```
()()() â†£ (Îµ)()() â†£ (S)()() â†£ S()() â†£ S(Îµ)() â†£ S(S)() â†£
SS() â†£ SS(Îµ) â†£ SS(S) â†£ SSS â†£ SS â†£ S
```

("â†£" reads as "derives from")

This is a **left-most reduction**, but a **right-most derivation**.

Left-most reduction:

```
()()()
 S()()
 S S()
  S ()
  S S
Â Â Â S
```

Right-most derivation:

```
   S
  S S
  S ()
 S S ()
 S ()()
 ()()()
```



A **sentential form** is a string of variables and terminals i.e. each step of a derivation.

- If you have:
  
  - some sentential forms u := xhy and v := xTy
  
  - G contains a rule T â†’ h
  
  - T is a non-terminal i.e. T âˆˆ V

- Then:
  
  - u â†£ v using the rule T â†’ h to replace the reducing string h
  
  - i.e. xhy â†£ xTy using rule T â†’ h



There are actually **two** left-most reductions:

```
()()()
S ()()
S S ()
S S S !!! is this allowed? yes!
S S
S
```

Corresponds to the right-most derivation:

```
  S
 S S
() S S
   ()()
```

This looks like a violation of the very definition of a left-most reduction i.e. the fact we chose to reduce "()" instead of "SS" since there were rules for both and "SS" showed up on the left!

However, there's a difference in the negative definition ("you *cannot* reduce any string to the right of a reducible string") and the positive definition ("you *must* consider the string you chose to reduce as the left-most sentential form for the remainder of the reduction").

This is at the heart of DCFGs (deterministic context free grammars).

## Turing Machines ðŸ¤–ðŸ§ 

### Overview of Simpler Models

FSM:

```
Â Â Â Â  [FSM]
Â Â Â Â    â†‘
Â LeftÂ -|-> Right
Â Â Â Â    |
 [ | | | | | | |]
Â Â Â Â  u q v
```

The result of the FSM depend **solely** on state q and the rest of the input tape v.

PDA:

```
Â Â Â Â  [PDA] ------------> |_|
Â Â Â Â    â†‘Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â |_|
Â LeftÂ -|-> RightÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  |_| <-- Stack
Â Â Â Â    |Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  |_|
 [ | | | | | | |]
Â Â Â Â  u r v
```

The result of the PDA depend on the state r, v, and the contents of the stack.

# Week One, Lecture One

## About this Course
Imagine a Venn diagram with the left set comprised of "discrete math," "words," and "analysis" and the right set of "continuous math," "pictures," and "synthesis." Most math courses are strictly one set, usually the left. This course is in the intersection of the two sets: between discrete and continuous math; mathematical rigor and creativity.

This course has practical implications in compiler construction.

## "What can a computer do?"
The central question of this course. Some answers from the class were:
- storage of information
- perform mathematical instructions
- computation
- automate tasks

The professor's list was:
1. Inputs
2. Outputs
3. Programmable
4. Storage
5. Initial state
6. Deterministic
7. Finite number of operations at a time
8. Problem the computer is solving
9. Classes of problems

In the above list, 8 and 9 are not strictly the computer itself but its environment.

## Models
Every suspension bridge in the world is a parabola. Before we had a model for them, we didn't necessarily realize this but gravitated towards this conclusion naturally. 

We can analyze the suspension bridge according to different aspects, called **models**. Analogously, in linguistics we analyze language through *syntax*, *semantics*, *phonology*, etc. These are all different models of language.

A football field has specifications (models) such that - despite the complexity of the field's configuration - you only need to specify two numbers: its length and its width. Once you know these two numbers, you use the model of a football field and get a universally recognized result.

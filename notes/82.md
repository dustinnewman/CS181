# Week Eight, Lecture Two

"Thermodynamics owes more to the steam engine than the steam engine does to thermodynamics." Usually, the theory comes after the practice to explain why the practice actually works. People were randomly hammering on steam engines far before we knew how they really worked. 🤷‍♂️

This is not that. In our case, "the computer owes more to the Turing machine than the Turing machine does to the computer." The Turing machine *preceded* the actual physical computer and actively informed its real development.

## Turing Machines 🌌🧠

The **fundamental** difference between a TM and the other models is the **two-way, read-write, semi-infinite tape**. The TM still reads one symbol at a time, it just has more freedom to choose which symbol to read. It also only reads adjacent symbols i.e. it can only move the read-write head one symbol at a time. "Semi-infinite" here means that the input tape has a left edge (the start of the input string), but no right edge.

The presence of *N* work tapes is just a generalization that does not change the fundamentals of the machine, but does help show its real-world applications.

**Notation**: We use the ␢ (blank symbol) to denote **blank** - a special symbol not part of the input alphabet.

```
N = 3 work tapes
[ | | | | | | ... 
 ^  [ | | | | | | ...
 |   ^  [ | | | | | | ...
 |   |   ^ <--- Read-write heads
|---------------------|  /--> ((A))
| [q0]                |-|
|---------------------|  \--> [R]
TM with start state q0, accepting state A, rejecting state R

[ w | w | w | w | ... | w | ␢ | ␢ | ...
Input tape
```

Unlike FSMs, TMs **only have one accepting state** and **one rejecting state**. If there is ever an unspecified transition, we use the convention from the other models and **block**. 🛑

### Decider vs Recognizer

If a TM **always halts** on any input and either accepts or rejects that input, we call it a "**decider**" because it always *decides* if the input is valid or not.

If a TM halts **and accepts all accepted inputs** and either (hallts and rejects) OR (never halts) on **all non-accepted inputs**, then we call it a "**recognizer**".

A **recognizer** is a less strict form of a decider.

|                            | Decider | Recognizer |
| -------------------------- |:-------:|:----------:|
| Accepts accepted input     | ✅       | ✅          |
| Rejects non-accepted input | ✅       | ❌          |

Basically, a recognizer does not have to actively reject something if it doesn't accept it. It simply *recognizes* valid inputs. A decider takes a more active approach and *decides* if any given input string is accepted or rejected.

### Transducer

A transducer has a special **output tape**, where it writes the particular output for any given input.

### Generator/Enumerator

Can we have something without any input? Is such a thing even useful?

Sure it is! Think of: clocks, a prime number generator, a random number generator, etc.

Consequently, a **generator** (or **enumerator**) has no input tape, and only an output tape.

One interesting idea is a "language generator" which just outputs every string in a given language and takes no input. If the language is a finite set, it will eventually stop. If not, it will continue forever without halting.

### Church-Turing Thesis

"Any model equivalent to the Turing machine represents computation."

This thesis is very important because it allows us to innovate and think of computers in new ways with new models without affecting our fundamental reasoning.

### Overview of TM Types

| Behavior       | Machine Family          | Language Family        |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Always-halting | Deciders, algorithms    | Recursive, decidable   |
| Halt to accept | Recognizers, procedures | Recursively enumerable |

### Closure Properties

#### Intersection

If L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> are rercursive, then so is L<sub>1</sub> ∪ L<sub>2</sub>.

```
|----|--> ((A))
| M1 |
|----|--> [[R]]


|----|--> ((A))
| M2 |
|----|--> [[R]]
```

To create the union, we:

1. Copy w to a work tape

2. Run M1
   
   1. We remove the rejecting state from M1 to ensure we only have one rejecting state
   
   2. We keep M1's accepting state as the sole accepting state

3. Erase the input tape

4. Copy w back to input tape from work tape from step (1)

5. Erase all work tapes

6. Run M2
   
   1. We remove the accepting state and instead transition to M1's accepting state (since an input accepted by M2 is also accepted by M1 ∪ M2)
   
   2. We keep M2's rejecting state as the sole rejecting state

```
  |---------|   |----|--> ((A)) <----------------------|
->| copy w  |-> | M1 |                                 |
  | to work |   |----|-----|                           |
  | tape    |              |                           |
  |---------|              v                           |
                         |---------|           |----|--|
                         | copy w  |---------> | M2 |
                         | back to |           |----|--> [[R]]
                         | inp tape|
                         |---------|           
```

This algorithm creates an **always halting** TM i.e. a **decider**.

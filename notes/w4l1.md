# Week Four, Lecture One
## Pumping Lemma Proofs üö≤üí®
You **can**:
- select any string s ‚àà L where |s| >= p
- accidentally choose some *s* which DOES satisfy the pumping lemma and CAN be pumped to any length

You **cannot**:
- assume the partition of *xyz* e.g. "let x = ..." or "let xy = ..."
- assume that some "{w | w=rst}" means x=r, y=s, z=t
    - x,y,z can be ANY possible assignment
    - you have to show that NO possible assignment works

## Chomsky Hierarchy Proofs
Remember that the following models are all equivalent:
<div align="center">
DFA ‚â£ NFA ‚â£ GNFA ‚â£ RegEx
</div>

- It is rather trivial that a DFA is equivalent to an NFA, as a DFA is just a specific, particularly strict *type* of NFA
- It is also intuitive that an NFA is equivalent to a GNFA, as a GNFA is a *generalized* NFA

However, the following proofs are less obvious and we'll be going over (within a week at least):
1. NFA ‚â£ DFA
2. RegEx ‚â£ NFA i.e. grep is taking a pattern (RegEx) and going to an executable program (specifically RegEx ‚Üí NFA ‚Üí DFA)
3. GNFA ‚â£ RegEx

Note that **all** these proofs are *constructive* proofs i.e. we will be proving you can construct one from the other.

## RegEx ‚â£ GNFA
Take your initial state in your GNFA and your accepting state. Since GNFAs allow more than one matched symbol per transition, we can literally just put the RegEx *R* on that one label from q<sub>0</sub> to q<sub>A</sub>.

## NFA ‚â£ DFA
You are given an NFA *N* := (Q, Œ£, Œ¥, q<sub>0</sub>, F) and the language that is accepted by N is ‚Ñí(N). Your task is to show that there is some DFA *M* (remember that these are all constructive proofs!) such that ‚Ñí(M) = ‚Ñí(N) i.e. N and M accept the same language.

</div>

M := (ùí´(Q), Œ£, Œ¥', ?, F').

Every possible state that N could ever go through is denoted as Œ¥<sup>\*</sup>(q<sub>0</sub>, w) = R for some string w in ‚Ñí(N) i.e. given some string in ‚Ñí(N), our machine N must accept that string. (R ‚äÜ F).

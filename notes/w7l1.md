Finite state languages are a subset of deterministic context free languages, which are a subset of context free languages. Note that, unlike finite state languages, the deterministic and non-deterministic variants of context-free languages are NOT 🙅‍♂️ equivalent. The non-deterministic CFLs are more powerful and thus there are certain languages (i.e. sets of strings) which may only be represented by a NPDA (non-deterministic pushdown automaton).

From a bird's eye view, these languages are all subsets of the universe of the powerset of the alphabet 𝒫(Σ<sup>*</sup>) i.e. all possible groupings of all possible strings over a given alphabet.

## Non-Determinism 🔮

It's easy to get caught up in epsilon-transitions when talking about non-determinism, but the real essence is: when you look at the graph, ask yourself "*does the machine ever have a choice?*" Is there ever more than one legal move a machine can take? If so, it's non-deterministic.

## Deterministic PDA 👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨

The definition we use is a **6-tuple** (another is a 7):

<div align='center'>
DPDA := (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q<sub>0</sub>, F)
</div>

The only difference between an NPDA and this is the delta function:

- δ: Q × Σ × Γ → (Q × Γ) ∪ {Ø} **such that:**

- for all q ∈ Q, a ∈ Σ, x ∈ Γ, **exactly one** of the following exists:
  
  - δ(q, a, x) - Read a and pop x
  
  - δ(q, a, ε) - Read a and pop nothing
  
  - δ(q, ε, x) - Read nothing and pop x
  
  - δ(q, ε, ε) - Read nothing and pop nothing

This is **not** "at most one"! This is <u>exactly</u> one i.e. we must have *some* choice. This is what makes it deterministic!

However, if we have δ(q, ε, ε) defined for any state q, then we **cannot have any other transitions** because that would mean the machine has a choice.

| Q   | Σ   | Γ   |                                |
| --- | --- | --- | ------------------------------ |
| q   | a   | $   |                                |
| q   | a   | a   |                                |
| q   | a   | ε   | No other stack symbols for a   |
| q   | b   | $   |                                |
| q   | b   | a   |                                |
| q   | b   | ε   | No other stack symbols for b   |
| q   | ε   | $   | No other alphabet symbol for $ |
| q   | ε   | a   | No other alphabet symbol for a |
| q   | ε   | ε   | NO TRANSITIONS ALLOWED FOR q   |

Having an ε in either the alphabet or the stack position "blacks out" the rest of the possibilities for the respective position. If we have a ε in the alphabet position, then we cannot define any other alphabet rules for the stack symbo! If we have a ε in the stack position, then we cannot define any other stack position rules for the alphabet symbol! If we have a ε in BOTH, then that is the only rule we can have for state q.

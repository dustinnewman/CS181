Finite state languages are a subset of deterministic context free languages, which are a subset of context free languages. Note that, unlike finite state languages, the deterministic and non-deterministic variants of context-free languages are NOT 🙅‍♂️ equivalent. The non-deterministic CFLs are more powerful and thus there are certain languages (i.e. sets of strings) which may only be represented by a NPDA (non-deterministic pushdown automaton).

From a bird's eye view, these languages are all subsets of the universe of the powerset of the alphabet 𝒫(Σ<sup>*</sup>) i.e. all possible groupings of all possible strings over a given alphabet.

## Non-Determinism 🔮

It's easy to get caught up in epsilon-transitions when talking about non-determinism, but the real essence is: when you look at the graph, ask yourself "*does the machine ever have a choice?*" Is there ever more than one legal move a machine can take? If so, it's non-deterministic.

## Deterministic PDA 👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨

The definition we use is a **6-tuple** (another is a 7):

<div align='center'>
DPDA := (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q<sub>0</sub>, F)
</div>

The only difference between an NPDA and this is the delta function:

- δ: Q × Σ × Γ → (Q × Γ) ∪ {Ø} **such that:**

- for all q ∈ Q, a ∈ Σ, x ∈ Γ, **exactly one** of the following exists:
  
  - δ(q, a, x) - Read a and pop x
  
  - δ(q, a, ε) - Read a and pop nothing
  
  - δ(q, ε, x) - Read nothing and pop x
  
  - δ(q, ε, ε) - Read nothing and pop nothing

This is **not** "at most one"! This is <u>exactly</u> one i.e. we must have *some* choice. This is what makes it deterministic!

However, if we have δ(q, ε, ε) defined for any state q, then we **cannot have any other transitions** because that would mean the machine has a choice.

| Q   | Σ   | Γ   |                                |
| --- | --- | --- | ------------------------------ |
| q   | a   | $   |                                |
| q   | a   | a   |                                |
| q   | a   | ε   | No other stack symbols for a   |
| q   | b   | $   |                                |
| q   | b   | a   |                                |
| q   | b   | ε   | No other stack symbols for b   |
| q   | ε   | $   | No other alphabet symbol for $ |
| q   | ε   | a   | No other alphabet symbol for a |
| q   | ε   | ε   | NO TRANSITIONS ALLOWED FOR q   |

Having an ε in either the alphabet or the stack position "blacks out" the rest of the possibilities for the respective position. If we have a ε in the alphabet position, then we cannot define any other alphabet rules for the stack symbol! If we have a ε in the stack position, then we cannot define any other stack position rules for the alphabet symbol! If we have a ε in BOTH, then that is the only rule we can have for state q. 

Is the following a DPDA?

```
->()-- ε,ε→$ -->[]-- (,ε→( --/
   \-- ε,$→ε --/  \-- ),(→ε --/
```

**No**, because we have two transitions leaving the non-accepting state in the form ε, x and a, ε which will **always conflict** with each other. Essentially, the "ε, x" says "I don't care what the input symbol is as long as the stack symbol is x" and the "a, ε" says "I don't care what the stack symbol is as long as the input symbol is a." You can kinda see the conflict already: What about "a, x"? Which transition has "precedence"? We are giving the machine a choice/decision, thus non-determinism.

However, if we think about it a little 🧠we can really only have this situation when we are reading a "(" and we have a "$" at the top of the stack i.e. *at the beginning of every valid string*. So, to help make this deterministic, we can just move this ambiguity - this decision about if we are encountering the first left parenthese of not - to the initial stack movement itself.

The DPDA is really:

```
->()-- (,ε→$ -->[]-- (,ε→( --/
   \-- ),$→ε --/  \-- ),(→ε --/
```

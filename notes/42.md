# Week Four, Lecture Two

## RegEx ≣ NFA

Remember that for RegExes we had six "cases":

1. Literals

2. Empty string

3. Empty set

4. Union

5. Concatenation

6. Kleene-star

So, to show that RegExes are equivalent to NFA, we will show each case.

### Literals

<u>a</u> is equivalent to an NFA with an edge from q<sub>0</sub> to q<sub>a</sub> which is accepting:

```
--> [q0]--a--> (qa)
```

### Empty string

ε is equivalent to an NFA with just q<sub>0</sub> in accepting state:

```
--> (q0)
```

### Empty set

Ø is equivalent to an NFA with just q<sub>0</sub> as non-accepting:

```
--> [q0]
```

### Union 🦄

If we have R<sub>1</sub> ∪ R<sub>2</sub>, then we must have some NFA accepting R<sub>1</sub> and some NFA accepting R<sub>2</sub>. How do we create an NFA which recognizes the union of those two?

```
R1 NFA:
    --> [q0]--?--> something something--> (qA1)
R2 NFA:
    --> [q0]--?--> something something--> (qA2)
COMBINED NFA:
               /--ε--> R1 NFA
    --> [q0]--|
               \--ε--> R2 NFA
```

If we really want to maintain only one accepting state, then we can make `qA1` and `qA2` non-accepting and create epsilon-edges from them to a new, singular accepting state:

```
COMBINED NFA:
               /--ε--> R1 NFA --ε--\
    --> [q0]--|                     |--> (qA)
               \--ε--> R2 NFA --ε--/
```

### Concatenation 🐱

Using R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> from above, we take those machines as follows:

```
R1 NFA:
    --> [q01]--?--> something something--> (qA1)
R2 NFA:
    --> [q02]--?--> something something--> (qA2)
```

We make `qA1` non-accepting (this time it's required), and literally *concatenate* them together. Simple! 🍋

```
COMBINED NFA:
    --> [q01]--?--> R1--> [qA1]--ε--> [q02]--> R2--> (qA2)
```

### Kleene star 🌟

We have just R<sub>1</sub> this time (star is a unary operation).

```
R1 NFA:
    --> [q1]--?--> stuff--> (qA)
```

We basically **add a loop**. However, we can't just add an epsilon-edge from q<sub>A</sub> to q<sub>1</sub>, since that would not guarantee that we accepting the empty string.

```
                 v---------ε--------\
--> [q0]--ε--> [q1]--?--> stuff--> [qA]--ε--> (qACC)
      \--------------------ε---------------------^
```

The idea here is just to add **four epsilon edges**: one from the previous accepting state (q<sub>A</sub>) to the previous initial state (q<sub>1</sub>); one from the new initial state (q<sub>0</sub>) to the new accepting state (q<sub>ACC</sub>); one from the new initial state to the old initial state; and one from the old accepting state to the new accepting state.

- Two into the new accepting state
  
  - One from old accepting state
  
  - One from new initial state

- Two into the old initial state
  
  - One from old accepting state
  
  - One from new initial state

Now that we've covered each six cases, we have proven that **RegEx ≣ NFA**.

## Closure

We're gonna use a whole new special term for a set of languages, now called a **family** 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦 of languages to imply that they have something in common.

- ex: the set of all languages with only even-length strings is called a family

- if we take any two languages in that family and concatenate them together, we are guaranteed to have *another* member of that family!

- so a family allows us to reason more clearly and definitively about languages

Note that that phenomenon is NOT a property of those two languages specifically, but a property of that *family* of languages as whole.

- we could take *any* two languages in that famiy and get the same result

Another term! If performing some operation `op` on a family F always results in another language in F, then we say F is **closed under op**.

<div align="center">
(L<sub>1</sub> op L<sub>2</sub>) ∈ F
</div>

So, we say things like "union is a **closure property** of regular languages" or "regular languages are closed under concatenation."

### Closed under Intersection

We have an alphabet Σ and two regular languages L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>. We claim that regular languages are closed under intersection.

Since we have two regular languages, we know we have two respective machines M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub>.

<div align="center">
M<sub>1</sub> := (Q<sub>1</sub>, Σ, δ<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>1</sub>)
<br>
M<sub>2</sub> := (Q<sub>2</sub>, Σ, δ<sub>2</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>)
<br>
</div>

NFAs are practically built on "OR" (e.g. the idea that any one thread accepting means the whole computation accepts). However, it's harder to say that they use "AND." What *does* use AND though... is a DFA!

So, we're gonna construct one DFA for *both* languages such that all strings in both L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> (i.e. L<sub>1</sub> ∩ L<sub>2</sub>) are accepted by this DFA, which we will call "N," even though it's slightly confusing.

<div align="center">
N := (Q', Σ, δ', (q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>), F')
<br>
</div>

The idea here is to "manage" both NFAs and make sure that they both accept. For this, we need to include the entirety of the states from both NFAs.

- Q' = Q<sub>1</sub> × Q<sub>2</sub> i.e. every possible combination of both NFA states

Rather helpfully, we can use the original transition functions in our definition of our new transition function. We basically don't do any work ourselves!

- δ'((q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>), a) = (δ<sub>1</sub>(q<sub>1</sub>, a), δ<sub>2</sub>(q<sub>2</sub>, a))
  
  - We know our new transition function must return a *pair* of states, so the intuition here basically writes it for us.

What do we want our final states to look like? We know it's gonna be a pair of states. Since it's final states, we also want our new final states to *both* be final states in their respective machines.

- F' = {(r, s) | (r, s) ∈ Q<sub>1</sub> × Q<sub>2</sub>, r ∈ F<sub>1</sub> **AND** s ∈ F<sub>2</sub>}

- The fact that this is an "AND" is what makes this an intersection!

- If we used an "OR," we would be showing that regular languages are closed under *union*.

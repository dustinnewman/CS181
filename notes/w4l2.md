# Week Four, Lecture Two

## RegEx ≣ NFA

Remember that for RegExes we had six "cases":

1. Literals

2. Empty string

3. Empty set

4. Union

5. Concatenation

6. Kleene-star

So, to show that RegExes are equivalent to NFA, we will show each case.

### Literals

<u>a</u> is equivalent to an NFA with an edge from q<sub>0</sub> to q<sub>a</sub> which is accepting:

```
--> [q0]--a--> (qa)
```

### Empty string

ε is equivalent to an NFA with just q<sub>0</sub> in accepting state:

```
--> (q0)
```

### Empty set

Ø is equivalent to an NFA with just q<sub>0</sub> as non-accepting:

```
--> [q0]
```

### Union 🦄

If we have R<sub>1</sub> ∪ R<sub>2</sub>, then we must have some NFA accepting R<sub>1</sub> and some NFA accepting R<sub>2</sub>. How do we create an NFA which recognizes the union of those two?

```
R1 NFA:
    --> [q0]--?--> something something--> (qA1)
R2 NFA:
    --> [q0]--?--> something something--> (qA2)
COMBINED NFA:
               /--ε--> R1 NFA
    --> [q0]--|
               \--ε--> R2 NFA
```

If we really want to maintain only one accepting state, then we can make `qA1` and `qA2` non-accepting and create epsilon-edges from them to a new, singular accepting state:

```
COMBINED NFA:
               /--ε--> R1 NFA --ε--\
    --> [q0]--|                     |--> (qA)
               \--ε--> R2 NFA --ε--/
```

### Concatenation 🐱

Using R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> from above, we take those machines as follows:

```
R1 NFA:
    --> [q01]--?--> something something--> (qA1)
R2 NFA:
    --> [q02]--?--> something something--> (qA2)
```

We make `qA1` non-accepting (this time it's required), and literally *concatenate* them together. Simple! 🍋

```
COMBINED NFA:
    --> [q01]--?--> R1--> [qA1]--ε--> [q02]--> R2--> (qA2)
```

### Kleene star 🌟

We have just R<sub>1</sub> this time (star is a unary operation).

```
R1 NFA:
    --> [q1]--?--> stuff--> (qA)
```

We basically **add a loop**. However, we can't just add an epsilon-edge from q<sub>A</sub> to q<sub>1</sub>, since that would not guarantee that we accepting the empty string.

```
                 v---------ε--------\
--> [q0]--ε--> [q1]--?--> stuff--> [qA]--ε--> (qACC)
      \--------------------ε---------------------^
```

The idea here is just to add **four epsilon edges**: one from the previous accepting state (q<sub>A</sub>) to the previous initial state (q<sub>1</sub>); one from the new initial state (q<sub>0</sub>) to the new accepting state (q<sub>ACC</sub>); one from the new initial state to the old initial state; and one from the old accepting state to the new accepting state.

- Two into the new accepting state
  
  - One from old accepting state
  
  - One from new initial state

- Two into the old initial state
  
  - One from old accepting state
  
  - One from new initial state

Now that we've covered each six cases, we have proven that **RegEx ≣ NFA**.

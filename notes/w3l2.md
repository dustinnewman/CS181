# Week Three, Lecture Two

## Recap

### Context-Free Grammars

Just like finite state languages can be represented by a finite state machine, context free languages can be represented by context-free grammars.

Remember the small part of the CFL block on the Chomsky Hierarchy from week one and the professor said we would cover it later? Well, those are the **inherently ambiguous CFLs**.

A given **context-free grammar** (CFG) "G" consists of:

<div align="center">
G := (V, Œ£, R, S)
</div>

- V = set of variables

- Œ£ = alphabet

- R = **rewriting/substitution rules**

- S = **starting variable**

L(G) is the *language* of G i.e. the set of all strings G generates.

When you take a given word *w* ‚àà ‚Ñí(G), you can view *w*  by expanding the nodes of the parse tree (which starts at "S") and viewing the derivation.

### Derivations

Two types of derivations for any given tree:

1. **Exactly left-most**

2. **Exactly right-most**

These two derivations are NOT equal, but the bottoms of both (i.e. all terminal symbols) will both evaluate to "w."

### Ambiguity

If w has more than one tree, w is **ambiguous** in G.

- i.e. there is more than one way to derive the same word

If a grammar G generates even one ambiguous word, the **grammar itself** is ambiguous.

- This DOES NOT mean the language created by G is ambiguous though!

For a language L to be ambiguous, ALL grammars for L are ambiguous.

- If L has just one unambiguoous grammar, then it is NOT ambiguous.

There is **no algorithm** to determine ambiguity.

- It is easy to show a grammar is ambiguous: just find one ambiguous string.

- It is hard to show a grammar is unambiguous. There is no algorithm for doing so.

Given a grammar, can you show that the language L(G) is unambiguous?

- Yes, but it is very difficult, as you have to show that the *infinite* set of grammars are all unambiguous.

An **inherently ambiguous language** is a **non-regular language**, but we won't get to that for awhile.

## Generalized NFAs (GNFAs)

GNFAs were invented to simplify proofs.

Imagine a DFA. It has its transition function Œ¥ : (Q √ó Œ£) ‚Üí Q.

An NFA has its transition function Œ¥ : (Q √ó (Œ£ ‚à™ {Œµ})) ‚Üí Q.

Therefore, the "G" in "GNFA" means to generalize the transition function so that we can label the edges of the machine with an entire regular expression: Œ¥: (Q - {F} √ó Q - {q<sub>0</sub>}) ‚Üí ‚Ñõ where ‚Ñõ is "all possible regular expressions over Œ£."

- We have a function which, for every possible pair of nodes, gives us the regular expression which can transition from one to another.

- This allows us to "skip over" input symbols, unlike in NFAs and DFAs.

- The complicated-looking part about - {q<sub>0</sub>} just means we can't transition into the starting symbol with a regular expression.

- Similarly, we cannot transition into the accepting state *F* (also called q<sub>A</sub>). In GNFAs, we can **only have one accepting state**.

<div align="center">
GNFA := (Q,Œ£, Œ¥, q<sub>0</sub>,q<sub>A</sub>)
</div>

GNFAs are allowed to transition from two nodes *p* and *q* on any input sequence of zero or more symbols as long as those symbols match *R*.

i.e. GNFAs **do pattern matching** to transition between two nodes.

ex: USD currency notation üíµ:

```mermaid
graph LR
    q0--$-->$
    $--0-->NO$s
    $--D1D*-->$s
    NO$s--dot-->dot
    $s--dot-->dot
    dot--DD-->qA((qA))
```

<div align="center">
D := 0...9
<br>
D<sub>1</sub> := 1... 9
</div>

## Pumping Lemma :muscle:

The pumping lemma lets us prove that a language is **not** regular.

If L is a finite state language then there exists a constant p (that depends only on L) such that for every string s in L, if s is longer than p:

- There exists substrings x, y, z such that s can be represented as s=xyz
  
  - No overlaps! üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- x and z are in Sigma-star: *x*,*z* ‚àà Œ£<sup>\*</sup>

- y is in Sigma-plus *y* ‚àà Œ£<sup>+</sup>

- y is longer than 0 (i.e. y is not the empty string)

- len(x) + len(y) <= p

- for all i, xy<sup>i</sup>z is in L
  
  - "x, y repeated i times, z"
  
  - **the most important one**

### Example

<div align="center">
Œ£ := {a,b}
<br>
L := {ww | w ‚àà Œ£<sup>\*</sup>}
</div>

1. To prove that L is **not** an FSL, suppose by contradiction that L was an FSL.

2. Because L is an FSL, the pumping lemma applies

3. Then there is some number "p" for every string "s" in L that is longer than "p" such that:
   
   1. there exists some x,y,z such that s = xyz
   
   2. len(xy) <= p
   
   3. len(y) >= 1
   
   4. for all i, xy<sup>i</sup>z is in L

4. Choose "s" = a<sup>p</sup>ba<sup>p</sup>b

5. s is in L because "w" = a<sup>p</sup>b

6. Per (3.1), s = xyz
   
   1. Note that (3.1) just says *there exists*, not *for all*!
   
   2. So we can't just show some particular xyz doesn't work out. We have to show that NO xyz works.

7. Since len(xy) <= p, we know that xy must consist just of a<sup>p</sup>
   
   1. If not, say we added the "b," then - since we have "p" repetitions of "a" - the len(xy) would be GREATER than p.

8. Thus:
   
   1. x = a<sup>n</sup> for some n >= 0
   
   2. y = a<sup>m</sup> for some m >= 1

9. Per (7), "z" consists of the rest of the "abab" string:
   
   1. z = a<sup>(p-n-m)</sup>ba<sup>p</sup>b

10. Per (8) and (9.1):
    
    1. s = a<sup>n</sup>a<sup>m</sup>a<sup>(p-n-m)</sup>ba<sup>p</sup>b

11. Let i = 0, then s' = xy<sup>0</sup>z

12. s' = a<sup>n</sup>a<sup>(p-n-m)</sup>ba<sup>p</sup>b

13. (12) is NOT in L because it can never be "ww" since the first half has fewer a's than the second half.

14. Contradiction! ‚ö†Ô∏è  (13) and (3.4)

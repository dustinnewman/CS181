# 3.1: Turing Machines 🤖🧠

Turing machines **are** computation. Literally we define "computation" around Turing machines. What a TM can solve is "computable." What it cannot, is not "computable."

A TM is different from an FSM:

1. A TM can **both read and write** the tape

2. The head can move **both left and right**

3. The tape is **infinite** 🌌

4. Accept and reject states are **halting** 🛑

## Example

Consider the classic

<div align='center'>
B = {w#w | w ∈ {0,1}<sup>*</sup>}
</div>

The TM to match this is just what we would do if we had a too-long-to-memorize string:

1. Zig-zag across opposite sides of the tape on either side of the #, each time checking if the two match. If they do not, reject immediately. If they do, continue.

2. When all symbols on the left side are crossed off, if there are any others on the right, reject. If not, accept! ✅

## Formal Definition

Since it's über-mega-more powerful than anything else we've seen, it's only fitting that the Turing machine has an even more crazy definition to go along with it. It's a **7-tuple**!

<div align='center'>
TM := (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q<sub>0</sub>, q<sub>accept</sup>, q<sub>reject</sub>)
</div>

⚠️NOTE! **The input alphabet is a subset of the tape alphabet.** Σ ⊂ Γ.

The thing that makes a Turing machine really special though is the **transition function** which is of the formal form:

<div align='center'>
δ: Q × Γ → Q × Γ × {L, R}
</div>

This tells us that only (1) the current state and (2) the current tape contents determines the next state, anything written to the tape, and the next location of the head. These last three are called a **configuration** of a TM:

<div align='center'>
configuration c = (string u)(state q)(string v)
</div>

where *u* is the tape contents preceding the head, *q* is the current state of the TM, and *v* is the tape contents following the head, where the first symbol of *v* is what the head is pointing to.

```
configuration uqv =>
             [q]
              |
[ u | u | u | v | v | v | ... 
```

We say that one configuration **yields** another when we can go from the first configuration to the second in one move.

<div align='center'>
uaq<sub>i</sub>bv <em>yields</em> uabq<sub>j</sub>v
</div>

if and only if δ(q<sub>i</sub>, b) = (q<sub>j</sub>, b, R)

```
        [q_i]
          |
[ u | u | a | b | v | ... 
          
        YIELDS
                [q_j]
                  |
[ u | u | a | b | v | ...
```

Some special configurations are:

- The **start configuration** q<sub>0</sub>w

- An **accepting configuration** uq<sub>accept</sub>v

- A **rejecting configuration** uq<sub>reject</sub>v

Accepting and rejecting configurations do not yield any other configurations because they immediately halt. 🙅‍♂️

## Decidability 🔮

A TM has three options given an input string:

1. Accept

2. Reject

3. Loop

**Deciders**: Machines which **always halt**.

**Recognizers**: Machines which **correctly accept**.

A **decidable/recursive** language has at least some TM which decides it.

A **recognizable/recursively enumerable** langauge has at least some TM which recognizes it.

**All recursive languages are recursively enumerable.**
